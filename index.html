                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">The greatest success of a person is to be accompanied with his or her true love. It can be a person, a book, an interest, and even a faith. It makes our life lively and interesting, bringing us far away from the wasteland of inner world. I am very glad that I finally chose to study art design when I was admitted to the university several years ago. It’s a career deserving my life-long efforts and pursuit. I am confident that I can insist and perfect it with my life time. Nowadays, with quick development of economics, our life structures are experiencing huge changes. Relatively abundant life has made more and more common people began paying attention to the pursuit of beauty. As a result, design has become an essential element in our daily life. Particularly as computer science and new media technologies are widely used, the demands to graphic and communication design are also significantly increased.<div><br></div><div>As a student majoring in Communication Design in WSA currently, I have engaged in design study for over four years, and before this, since in the primary school, I have started learning watercolour painting, sketch, and calligraphy. In my high school, I got more detailed and systematic knowledge about the graphic design field in the process of studying painting. Years of efforts and cultivation in painting and design not only honed my aesthetic sensibility, perception of the world around us, and understanding of human needs, but also motivated me to enrich myself with art and culture knowledge all over the world, as well as diversified practical design and communication skills. It is a process of testing my potentials and giving free play of my creative mind. My designs are characterized by bold originality, tempered by meticulous attention to even the minutest detail. Bearing the dream of being an excellent designer and having my own design studio in the future in my mind.</div><br><div><br></div></h3>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div>Taking my portfolio as an example, bottle design is only one of all the themes. Before the production, I did some practices and researches on the water towns in the south of the Yangtze river, hoping to combine the bottle of wine with the water towns in the south of the Yangtze river. Sufficient previous research is indispensable for a product, which can help me rapidly build up my understanding of the product and make my ideas continue to be extended.  As Brenda Laurel (2003) stated, “In the old model, market research was a back-end process, devoted primarily to the final stages of development including styling, packaging, branding, marketing and advertising. In the emerging paradigm, the process is being inverted, with design research as a front-end method, informing the development of products and services from the concept stage forward. In this way, design research can enable the product to speak for itself, freeing branding and marketing to move toward honest communication and away from persuasion and the creation of desire”(p.17).</div><div><br><div><br></div></div></h3>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div><br></div><div>A good design is often not to be narcissistic, but also to meet the different tastes of consumers and the market. The success of a designed product is usually judged not by how much money and energy it has invested, but by whether it can stand firm in the market and be accepted by the public. As Brenda Laurel said, “I think that every designer dreams of making work that makes a difference. Most designers are aware of the common misconceptions of the profession. Designers are variously seen as decorationists, elitists or servants of the consumerist machine. When their work is directed toward the marketplace, they rarely participate in the “research” that determines what product should be produced for whom or why. When their work focuses on the investigation of design through form and process, they often stand accused of irrelevance or indifference. When they found great movements like the Bauhaus, they may be seen as self-proclaimed dictators of style. Each of those attributions ultimately marginalizes designers and design”.</div><div><br></div><div>Therefore, in the sketch drawing of bottle shape, I gave up the peculiar shape (such as drum and female body), because such a bottle was difficult to be applied and produced. In the end, I chose the Chinese traditional object: lantern as the prototype and combined it with the bottle. “Human-centered design research encompasses a set of methods and practices aimed at getting insight into what would serve or delight people. It investigates behind the scenes, looking at individuals, situated contexts, cultures, forms, history, and even business models for clues that can inform design. Furthermore, good human-centered design research amplifies the designer's ability to shape popular culture and to smoothly transmit values through design”(p.16).</div></h3>

Then, I took inspiration from the arch of traditional Chinese garden architecture and combined it with the traditional pattern to form the pattern on the wine bottle. The name comes from the beautiful scenery in the south of the Yangtze river.<div>Prototyping is an essential step in the design process, and it helps you to have a general idea of what to look for before you make it, so that you don't have to risk failure to sculpt or make it directly. Firstly, I drew the exact three views and calculated the length, width and height. Then I printed the three views on the paper and cut and polished the plaster according to the proportion. Next, I drew the pattern on the plaster mountain with a pencil and then carved it. Therefore, prototyping is an essential step before formal creation and it is a good way to avoid risks. It can let you know what your design still needs to be improved and where needs to be changed. In this way, you can look at things with a dialectical perspective rather than an absolute one.</div><div><br></div><div>Through the current study, I have realized that my work still needs to be improved, for example, user experience survey needs to be added, user experience map and persona can not only intuitively reflect user satisfaction and emotional changes, but also enable designers to know their weakness and areas for improvement.</div></h3>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><em>The Shawshank redemption</em> mostly tells the story of banker Andy, whose "self-redemption" in order to regain his sight and pursue freedom. Shawshank's redemption can be said to be to a certain extent against the American dark &nbsp;judicial system and prison system composition. In my opinion, Andy is just one of the victims under the dark rule of American justice. What saved him is not the prison, but hope. It is hope that saved freedom and saved the soul.His freedom is quite simple and clear, it's just survival. Maybe shawshank can give us more. but imagine that in the real world when we face the pressure, chanllenge and risk, is it no longer brave, but to give up and escape, find indifferent and quiet as an excuse. And like shawshank spent half a century in prison finally won his permanent freedom, actually he cannot adapt to the outside world. In prison, he had the identity, by convincing the old man, the manager of the library, but in this society, he was nothing, he had used to life in prison, and finally, loneliness, disoriented and a kind of despair for the future ages that destoried him, he only in death can get relief. Even every man dies, but not every man really lives, life is too precious, do not allow us to waste, really lives to admit his real freedom, go to the end of the life back in life don't regret not to shake hands with freedom, but have to smile and say to the later generations, I was fighting in order to dream and freedom.</h3>
